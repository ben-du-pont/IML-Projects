READ ME:

This notebook contains two code blocks. The first code block contains our solution. This can be run from a google colab. The input data must be in a file named 'train.csv' within the working directory, and an output file is written within the working directory as well. 

The second code block is another attempt to obtain a solution using the sklearn RidgeCV class; this is not working yet. This should not be taken as a solution.
